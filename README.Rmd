# {simswjm}: Simulating Stepped Wedge Trials With and Without Informative Dropout

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The {simswjm} package can be used to simulate data from stepped wedge trials with a continuous, binary, or count longitudinal outcome.
Moreover, data can be simulated assuming both non-informative and informative dropout.

This package is a companion to the manuscript titled "Analysis of cohort stepped wedge cluster-randomized trials with non-ignorable dropout via joint modeling", which is currently submitted for publication.
A pre-print is available on arXiv.
